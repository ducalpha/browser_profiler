# Browser Profiler

A tool for profiling energy consumption of web browser during web page loading.

[Design and How to Patch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GmUjzytqePOqvnfsUt-sbVPjnJ3iOVsdZCksipiDZso/edit?usp=sharing)

Browser Profiler is designed as a portable library for convenient integration to different web browsers (e.g., Chromium and Firefox). A patch set for integrating Browser Profiler to Chromium 38 is included as an example for the glue code layer. However, it is easy to integrate to Chromium master branchâ€™s HEAD which I'd do upon request.

## Dependency
[Android cpu tools](https://github.com/ducalpha/android_cpu_tools) for determining number of CPU cores and running a synchronization workload.
